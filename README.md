This is sample code that Jack Tuszynski wrote in angular.   It consists of a form that either allows a user to use google autocomplete to figure out an address or input the address manually.  The addresses are limited to Southern California, specifically the Los Angeles region.   The form has validation which indicates if a user has not filled in the required fields or input an address outside the SoCal region.
